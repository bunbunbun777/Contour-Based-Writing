# Contour Based Visually Writing System
Once a kid from a mountains was tired of ink pens and he thought to do something new. Well this line is just a joke. This porject is under developing stage and i myself is wondering what features can i add next? I get feedbacks from people on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramkrishna-acharya-91a217183/) and i am always grateful for the support i get.

## Introduction
The primary focus of this project is to perform a Gesture Based Writing System. But i have not used Gesture recognition here. In fact until the [5th version]() of this project i have not added gesture recognition scheme. Hence the correct name is Contour Based Writing System. The entire concepts of working system can be clearly understood by reading the [blog of first version]() where i have tried to explain theoritical concepts and all the workign ideas. If you have any ideas or thoughts about the system then you can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramkrishna-acharya-91a217183/). 

## Requirements
* OpenCv >=4.1.1
* Imutils >=0.5.3
* PyTesseract

If you are running this system after installation, then try to install libraries on virtual environment. Follow the official documentation of each library for easy installation.

## Inplementation
Until 5th version, the system is only python code and there is nothing like implementation. However i have made it Web based.
